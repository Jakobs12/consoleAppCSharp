Assignment #2: Week 36
======================
This week's indivudial assignment will be on using regular expressions, collections, and iterators in C#.

C# part:
----------------
Fork this repository containing the C# solution.

Use the BibConsole to answer how many items contain the following search string:
- Agile Methodology
- Microsoft
- Software
- Primary
- Scaling Agile

To answer these questions, parts of the code currently missing need to be implemented. Follow the failing unit tests to see which code needs to be edited. Use regular expressions where possible for the implementation of the field checkers. As part of the *InMemoryItem* implementation you will need to use the iterator keywords 'yield' and 'break' you learned about. Your implementation is not allowed to use LINQ (System.Linq), which will be taught later in the course.


Submitting the assignment:
--------------------------
To submit the assignment, enter your answers into the answers.md file, complete the code and make a pull request. If you are in doubt of how to do this, then ask the TA's. Your pull request title should be your ITU initials and the assignment number. Eg 'jbec-bdsa-002'. You can use this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

This assignment will partly be corrected by automatically checking that your solution builds, and that your tests pass. The status of this will be visible in the pull request. Passing all tests does not mean that you passed the assignment, and not passing all tests does not mean you didn't. You might have a good reason for having tests that fail.

The submission deadline is **11th of September (Sunday) at midnight** and the latest commit on your fork will be corrected. If you solution is not approved you can commit new changes and comment on the pull request that you have re-submitted. Assignments that is resubmitted, or submitted late, will be put last in our correction stack.
